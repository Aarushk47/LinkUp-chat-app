1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/linkup.git
   cd linkup
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   After navigating into the project directory, install the necessary dependencies for both the frontend and backend.

   For the **backend**:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

   For the **frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root of both the **client** and **server** folders, and add the following environment variables:

   **Backend (`server/.env`)**:
   ```env
   MONGO_URI=your-mongo-uri
   JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloudinary-cloud-name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-cloudinary-api-key

   ```

   **Frontend (`client/.env`)**:
   ```env
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   In order to run the project locally, you'll need to run the frontend and backend servers:

   For the **backend**:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm start
   ```

   For the **frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

   Now, your application should be up and running! Visit `http://localhost:3000` for the frontend, and the backend will be accessible on `http://localhost:5000`.
